# EdgeSquare - Edge-2-Edge Display Simulator 

EdgeSquare is a web based online simulator for mobile edge-to-edge displays with notch or any other form of camera cutout. 
It can load your web-app via iframe and lets you choose from a number of devices with presets for the status bar, navigation bar, camera cutout (notches, holes, etc.) and some other properties.
In addition you can set your own colors for status bar and navigation bar to try out some design tweaks.  
  
Check out how your web application REALLY looks like on modern smartphones! ;-)  
  
## Getting started
